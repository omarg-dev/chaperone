# Agent checkout firewall (working title)

An intent firewall and adversarial test arena for AI shopping agents. Every purchase an agent makes is held as a payment authorization while a tree of reviewers checks that the cart still matches what the person asked for; only then is the money captured. The arena attacks shopping agents with poisoned listings, so you can measure how often they get tricked with and without the firewall.

Built solo for the hackathon. Sandbox payments only; no live credentials ever touch this project.

The product name isn't final, and the repository will be renamed before submission.

## Status

Planning. The stack is TypeScript (pnpm monorepo, Hono, React + Vite, SQLite); the decisions and milestones are in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

## Branches

```
feat/<thing> ──PR──▶ dev ──PR──▶ prod
                                  │
                              production
```

`dev` is the default branch: every change is a PR into it. A release is one PR from `dev` into `prod`, and only `prod` deploys. There's no staging.
